# Data Engineering with Rust

This repository consists of my Rust programming language codes and learning through Coursera, second course of the "Rust Programming" Specialization, "Data Engineering with Rust".

Some parts of this repository does not work for me, because I could not get APIs from the right companies. This is because I am poor and do not have enough money for these things. :D 
These parts are copy-pasted from the course's resources, and have not been tested at all. 

I am using [rust-cli-template][1] as the template for this repository.
